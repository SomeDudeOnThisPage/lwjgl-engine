# lwjgl-engine
This is a mess and a lot of things are not final / deprecated / have no use at all and are being developed. Also, spaghetti code.
The new version of the engine is based on ECS paradigms and implements a physics engine.
It kind-of evolved from my previous, abandoned [gl-engine](https://github.com/SomeDudeOnThisPage/gl-engine), which, in turn, is 
based upon an [isometric tile rendering engine](https://github.com/SomeDudeOnThisPage/isoengine).
